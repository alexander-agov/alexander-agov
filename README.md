I bring a diverse professional background to the table. 
I have over 10 years of experience as an accountant and tax expert, complemented by 3 years of experience as a legal counsel. 
Currently, I am pursuing studies in Software Engineering, focusing on C#, JavaScript, and Python.
I am now aspiring to transition into a full-stack developer role, 
with a particular interest in working with databases and artificial intelligence. 
To achieve this, I am open to training opportunities in software engineering and AI, even without compensation.
Additionally, I am fluent in Spanish, having self-studied and achieved a DELE Intermediate certification.
